Create a CSV that list the videos from the Youtube playlist you're current on.

The list is shown currently on the Console.

To access the console press right click in anywhere in the web page and then Inspect, or something like that. There will be a tab called Console. Pressing F12 will probably open this window too.

To place it on Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#trying_it_out
